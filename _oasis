Description:
  Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for
  maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression library;
  instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance,
  compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster
  for most inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to
  100% bigger. On a single core of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy
  compresses at about 250 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec
  or more.
  .
  Snappy is written in C++, this library implements OCaml bindings.
